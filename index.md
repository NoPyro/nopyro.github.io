# SERVER INFO

Info Page for the Vanilla-esque 1.16.3 Minecraft Server at: `147.135.181.214:25587` for the SUV2 Discord Server (and some others)! **Due to previous griefing the whitelist has been enabled, contact NoPyro#6891 on discord for verification and server access.**

If you wish to join 
[Squad Up || V2](https://discord.gg/c7ECZHS){:target="_blank"}
the invite is right here actually!

## RULES

1. Only those with explicit permission (members of the SUV2 Discord and/or mutual friends of NoPyro and Katateshi) are allowed to build on the island located at the waystone "Mondstatd"

2. For those who are granted permission to build on Mondstatd, do not build too close to any other house or base without the owner(s) permission.

3. Be nice. This rule is an obvious one. But I need to say it don't I?)

4. EVERYONE has permission to build waystones and make them public, meaning everyone will have them unlocked immediately, FO NOT FLOOD THE GLOBAL WAYPOINT LIST, I'm trusting you with this.

## MODPACK FILES

The server uses a few Forge mods for some additional features, you can grab a Twitch Modpack at this link. The Twitch Modpack may also be downloaded straight from the Twitch Client, this is heavily recommended:

### SETTING UP

If you need help setting the files up then feel free to contact me (NoPyro) with the discord account named above, otherwise you can ask for help in #gaming on the discord server.
